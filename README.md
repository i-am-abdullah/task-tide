## Node.js Backend

The backend for **TaskTide** is built using **Node.js**, providing a seamless, efficient way to manage tasks on the server side.

### Server-side Scripting
- Mastery of Node.js core modules such as `http`, `fs`, `path`, `buffer`, and `express`.
- Creation of a robust HTTP server with routing and middleware to handle incoming requests.
- Utilization of asynchronous programming techniques (callbacks, Promises, or `async/await`) to maintain smooth operations.

### Web Application Architecture
- Building a RESTful API with optimized endpoints to manage task data.
- Implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing tasks.
- Handling routing, middleware, and error management with efficiency.

### Data Management
- Direct interaction with a SQL database to demonstrate proficiency in SQL queries.
- Building solid data validation and access control mechanisms.
- Writing complex SQL queries to manage task data seamlessly.

## React.js Frontend

On the frontend, **TaskTide** uses **React.js** to deliver a modern, user-friendly interface that adapts to any task management style.

### Component-based Development
- Construction of reusable, modular components to ensure easy scalability and maintenance.
- State management and lifecycle methods to handle dynamic task interactions.
- Smooth data flow through `props`, `state`, and context to manage task-related information.

### State Management
- Implementation of state management, utilizing React's built-in tools or external libraries (like Redux, MobX).
- Handling asynchronous actions such as task creation, deletion, or updates.
- Managing both local component state and global application state for an optimized experience.

### Routing and Navigation
- Seamless client-side routing via React Router for easy navigation between task views.
- Dynamic routing to display different task lists, details, and filters.
- Handling complex route parameters and query strings.

### UI/UX and Responsive Design
- Use of modern CSS frameworks (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap) for responsive, clean design.
- Writing maintainable HTML and CSS for smooth, intuitive user interactions.
- Ensuring accessibility with best practices, making the app inclusive for all users.

## Full-stack Integration

Bringing it all together, **TaskTide** seamlessly integrates its backend and frontend to create a cohesive full-stack experience.

### API Integration
- Smooth integration with the Node.js API to fetch and display task data in real-time.
- Handling HTTP requests and responses to ensure synchronization between the frontend and backend.
- Implementing error handling and client-side data validation for a seamless user experience.

### State Synchronization
- Ensuring real-time updates and data consistency between the frontend and backend.
- Efficient use of state management to synchronize tasks across multiple views.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** and **npm** installed.
- **MySQL** or compatible database set up on your system or hosting platform.
- Basic understanding of JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, SQL, and web development.

### Installation
